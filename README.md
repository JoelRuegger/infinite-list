# Infinite List of GitHub Organizations

This project is a trial challenge for [Zeilenwerk] (https://www.zeilenwerk.ch/).
It enables you to load a number of organizations from GitHub and display them in a list.
Due to the lack of time and importance of this project the organizations listed might repeat themselves as it was not obvious from the start how many items are delivered per page. This is a problem for a future applicant.
All in all it was a fun experience and I hope that we never need to see this list in action again :sunglasses:
